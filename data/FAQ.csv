How to control bagworms  Shot holes on the leaves Bagworm,"Visible bags or affected leaves/branches should be removed manually to reduce the infestation.
Nearby host plants can remain unaffected as the females do not fly. Controlling the bagworms through insecticides may not be effective. These bagworms spend the egg stage within sealed bags. Subsequently, tiny caterpillars (around 10 mm) emerge and lower themselves on silken strands to new foliage to construct new bags which they carry upright as they move. As the caterpillars grow within the bags, the bags are enlarged. Full grown caterpillars within bags are up to 2.5 cm long before pupating. 7 -10 later, the pupae of male moths wriggle out of the bottom of the bags, leaving the empty pupal skins behind. Adult males have short 10-12 mm long clear wings, hairy black bodies and feathery antennae. They fly and seek out females to mate. Females do not develop into adult moths, but remain inside bags and resemble maggots, with no functional eyes, legs, mouthparts or antennae. After mating, females produce a large cluster of eggs inside their bodies and die. Infested plants develop more bagworms each year. They may become abundant enough in a few years to completely defoliate their host plant. "
