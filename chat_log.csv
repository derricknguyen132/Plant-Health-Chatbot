It sounds like your tomato plant may need some additional support and care. Here's some advice that might help:

1. Staking: Tomato plants often need support as they grow, especially if the fruit becomes heavy. Use a stake, cage or trellis to help support the weight of the plant.

2. Pruning: It could also be that the plant has too many unnecessary foliage and suckers that are diverting the plant's energy. Prune the plant to focus its energy on growing fruit. Do this by removing dead or yellow leaves and the small shoots that appear on the stem joints.

3. Feeding: Make sure the plant is being fed properly. Tomatoes need a balanced plant food once a fortnight after the first truss of fruit forms.

4. Watering: Keep the watering consistent. Irregular watering can lead to problems like blossom end rot and splitting. Try to water it early in the morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler to minimize evaporation. 

5. Environment: Check the area where your plant is based. Tomato plants need a lot of light and warm temperatures to fruit properly, ideally 6 to 8 hours of sun a day.

6. Patience: Sometimes, it could just be a matter of time. Some tomato varieties take longer to produce fruit, depending on their growing conditions.

If these tips don't help, consider reaching out to a local nursery or extension service. They often have experts who can help diagnose and treat plant problems.",self_generate
