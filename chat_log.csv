How does diatomaceous earth work,2024-10-28T08:26:04.565069,"*Disclaimer: The following response may not be accurate as your question was not found in the verified database.*

Diatomaceous earth, often referred to as DE, works in a unique way as an insecticide in the gardening world. This substance is made from fossilized remains of tiny, aquatic organisms known as diatoms. These diatoms have a skeletal structure made of a natural substance called silica.

When diatomaceous earth is sprinkled or spread around plants, insects that crawl across or ingest it will get tiny abrasive particles stuck to them or in their digestive tract. For insects, this is like walking over shards of glass. The particles cut into their exoskeletons or lining of the digestive tract and cause them to dehydrate and die eventually. 

DE is often used in gardening or houseplants because it's non-toxic for humans and pets, making it a safer option than many chemical insecticides. However, it should be noted that while the substance is non-toxic, it is an irritant, and precautions should be taken to avoid inhaling it.

Diatomaceous earth can control a variety of pests, such as slugs, beetles, aphids, mites, and other insects that can infest and harm plants. However, it is not selective and can also affect beneficial insects.

Please note, DE's effectiveness could be limited in wet conditions as it needs to be dry to work effectively. You might need to reapply it after heavy rain.

It's important to use food-grade DE in gardening and not the pool-grade type, which is chemically treated and labeled as an insecticide.",self_generate
