How does diatomaceous earth work,2024-10-28T08:26:04.565069,"*Disclaimer: The following response may not be accurate as your question was not found in the verified database.*

Diatomaceous earth, often referred to as DE, works in a unique way as an insecticide in the gardening world. This substance is made from fossilized remains of tiny, aquatic organisms known as diatoms. These diatoms have a skeletal structure made of a natural substance called silica.

When diatomaceous earth is sprinkled or spread around plants, insects that crawl across or ingest it will get tiny abrasive particles stuck to them or in their digestive tract. For insects, this is like walking over shards of glass. The particles cut into their exoskeletons or lining of the digestive tract and cause them to dehydrate and die eventually. 

DE is often used in gardening or houseplants because it's non-toxic for humans and pets, making it a safer option than many chemical insecticides. However, it should be noted that while the substance is non-toxic, it is an irritant, and precautions should be taken to avoid inhaling it.

Diatomaceous earth can control a variety of pests, such as slugs, beetles, aphids, mites, and other insects that can infest and harm plants. However, it is not selective and can also affect beneficial insects.

Please note, DE's effectiveness could be limited in wet conditions as it needs to be dry to work effectively. You might need to reapply it after heavy rain.

It's important to use food-grade DE in gardening and not the pool-grade type, which is chemically treated and labeled as an insecticide.",self_generate

Why is my plant underneath the leaves covered in wax?,2024-10-28T09:25:02.702756,"*Disclaimer: The following response may not be accurate as your question was not found in the verified database.*

Plants may develop a waxy coating under their leaves as a part of their natural growth process, which helps in reducing water loss. However, if you notice an unusual amount of wax, it could be due to a pest problem named Scale Insects. These tiny insects attach themselves to the plant and secrete a waxy coating for protection while they feed on the plant's sap. This can cause the leaves to wilt, yellow, or drop off. In severe cases, it may lead to stunted growth and even plant death.

To treat this, you can use a mixture of water and mild dish soap to gently wash the leaves. For more severe infestations, you may need to use a targeted insecticide or horticultural oil. Also, ensure that the plant is receiving the right amount of light and water. If you're uncertain, it's best to take a sample or a photo and consult with a local nursery or agricultural extension office. They can help you identify the problem and suggest appropriate treatments.

Always remember, prevention is better than cure. Regular inspection of your plants can prevent severe pest infestations. Regularly clean any fallen leaves or debris around your plants to prevent pests from taking hold.",self_generate
