Dealing with termites especially in a gardening context can be quite challenging. Here's a step-by-step guide to address termite infestations:

1. Identify Termite Variety: Recognize the type of termite you are dealing with as different types require different treatment methods. Subterranean termites require soil treatment, but drywood termites, often found in plants, may require fumigation.

2. Inspection: Regularly inspect your garden for signs of termites including, damaged wood, mud tubes, and discarded wings.

3. Remove Infected Plants: If you notice a plant or tree has been infested by termites, you might need to remove and dispose of it to prevent the termites from spreading throughout the garden.

4. Use Natural Predators: Beneficial insects like spiders, beetles, and ants are natural predators of termites. Birds are also great termite predators, so attracting birds to your garden could help.

5. Use Termite Treatment Solutions: This can include termite sprays, foams, and bait stations that are specifically designed to kill termites. Always follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions when using these products.

6. Get Professional Help: If the termite infestation is severe, it might be more effective to call a professional pest control service. They have specialized tools and knowledge to handle large infestations.

7. Prevention: Maintaining your garden regularly can help stop termite infestations before they occur. This includes keeping your garden clean and free of dead wood or plant debris, avoiding excessive mulch near home structures, and ensuring good drainage to avoid damp soil which attracts termites.

Remember, when dealing with chemicals or severe infestations, it's best to contact a professional to ensure the safety and health of your garden.",self_generate
