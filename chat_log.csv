It sounds like your tomato plant may need some additional support and care. Here's some advice that might help:

1. Staking: Tomato plants often need support as they grow, especially if the fruit becomes heavy. Use a stake, cage or trellis to help support the weight of the plant.

2. Pruning: It could also be that the plant has too many unnecessary foliage and suckers that are diverting the plant's energy. Prune the plant to focus its energy on growing fruit. Do this by removing dead or yellow leaves and the small shoots that appear on the stem joints.

3. Feeding: Make sure the plant is being fed properly. Tomatoes need a balanced plant food once a fortnight after the first truss of fruit forms.

4. Watering: Keep the watering consistent. Irregular watering can lead to problems like blossom end rot and splitting. Try to water it early in the morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler to minimize evaporation. 

5. Environment: Check the area where your plant is based. Tomato plants need a lot of light and warm temperatures to fruit properly, ideally 6 to 8 hours of sun a day.

6. Patience: Sometimes, it could just be a matter of time. Some tomato varieties take longer to produce fruit, depending on their growing conditions.

If these tips don't help, consider reaching out to a local nursery or extension service. They often have experts who can help diagnose and treat plant problems.",self_generate

It sounds like the tomato plant might be experiencing a few common issues. A weak stem and a lack of fruiting are usually signs of a deficiency in essential nutrients, sunlight, or water. 

1. Sunlight: Ensure the plant is getting full sunlight, at least 6-8 hours a day. Tomato plants are sun-loving plants.

2. Correct Watering: Are you watering the plant too much or too little? Over-watering can lead to a weak stem. Make sure that the soil is moist to touch and not waterlogged.

3. Nutrient Rich Soil: Check if your plant is getting necessary nutrients. Tomatoes require a well-draining soil rich in organic matter. You might want to consider adding a fertilizer high in phosphorus to promote fruiting.

4. Staking: To support the plant's growth, you can use stake, cage, or trellis. This will help to keep it upright and prevent the stem from bending due to weight as it grows.

5. Pruning: Regularly check on your plant and remove any useless leaves or suckers that are taking away energy from the growth of the main plant.

Remember, plants often take time to fruit, so patience is key. But applying these principles should help boost the overall health and production of your tomato plant.",self_generate
