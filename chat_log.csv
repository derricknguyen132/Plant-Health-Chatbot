How to deal with mealybugs?,2024-11-12T08:38:41.391802,"To control infestation in plants, thoroughly and diligently spray them with White summer oil, Neem oil or a DIY solution. This may be a diluted soap water solution (a tablespoon of soap mixed with 1L of water) or a mix of 1L water with one teaspoon each of vegetable oil and dishwashing liquid. An occasional spot application of recommended insecticides like imidacloprid or acetamaprid can help, as can wiping infested leaves with lukewarm water. For severe cases, change the soil, remove affected parts, use organic pesticides, and quarantine affected plants. Insecticidal soap, natural deterrent plants, or solutions using summer oil, chilli, onion, garlic or lemon drops may also be used. Additionally, regular checks, manual removal of pests, and adequate watering can prevent infestations.",database
